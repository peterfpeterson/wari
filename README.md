# wari (What Another Re-Install?)

The motivation behind this project was my constant hardware failures on my PC at work.  I have my dotfiles in a repo, but I didn't have anything that would setup and install packages in a platform (well only linux distro) agnostic way.  This is something essential for a habitual distro hopper such as myself!
